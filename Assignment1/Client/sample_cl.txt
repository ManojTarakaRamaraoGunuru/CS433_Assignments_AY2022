Client file

This is a client file eisting the client folder. You can verify by giving the  
absolute path of this file with UPD.

It simply indicates that the cient is trying to upload the file to the server.

You can also upload any file. But this is just  check sampple.

Also, If you give inappropriate file path, File will not be inserted.

Note that I used status Ok as my end of the file. Actually (status Ok)end of the file should not be there in the text.

For  more details, please refer the design doc.
